1.3.4
------

* renderer._value is deprecated. Use renderer.value

* added renderer.raw_value

* Model.__html__() (if any) is used to render model in read_only mode.

1.3.3
-----

* Added `.insert_after(field, new_field)`` to the `FieldSet` object.  Same
  as `.insert()`, except it adds it after the specified field.

* Docs improvements

* Fix 131 to 137

1.3.2
-----

* Added `.value_objects` to both Field and FieldRenderer objects. Returns the
  objects instead of list of primary keys when working with ForeignKeys.

* add IntervalFieldRenderer

* switch back to WebHelpers

* add Hungarian translation (125)

* fix bug with latest version of couchdbkit

* update paster template to Pylons 1.0b1

* fix issues 123, 124, 127, 128

1.3.1
-------

* include css in MANIFEST.in

1.3
-----

* new controllers to generate CRUD interfaces based on pylons RESTController

* couchdb support improvement (allow to use RESTController)

* Experimental RDFAlchemy support

* Add date formats to config module.

* add fs.copy()

* zope.schema.List and zope.schema.Choice support (thanks to Christophe Combelles)

* fix issues 107, 113, 114, 117, 118

* css improvement for pylons admin interface

1.2.1
-----

* Added fs.append(field) fs.insert(field, new_field) and del fs.field to
  Fieldset. fs.add() is deprecated.

* Added field.set() to modify the field inplace.

* bug fixes: issues 70, 80, 82, 97

* added spanish tanslation (thanks to robarago)

* added the `.with_html` method to `AbstractField` which will be
  passed to the renderers, allowing to add some HTML attributes to rendered
  HTML tags.  Removed html_options from render method.  (See issue #60)

* validators are now passed as second argument the `field` being validated. WARN:
  this will mean adding the parameter to your functions to be backwards compatible.
  The validator function signature changed from `myfunc(value)` to
  `myfunc(value, field=None)`.

* ext.couchdb now use couchdbkit instead of py-simplecouchdb

* added the `.with_metadata` method to `AbstractField` which allows
  you to add metadata to your field. The difference with `.with_html()` is that
  the attributes passed in will not be rendered in the HTML element, but are there
  only to be used in your templates, to tweak the output according to those
  properties. See docs/forms.txt


1.2
---

* add a paster template to bootstrap a pylons project with FA support enabled

* much sexier look for admin interface

* performance improvements

* non-SQLA Fields are no longer considered "experimental"

1.1
---

* formalchemy.ext.pylons.admin added; see
  http://docs.formalchemy.org/ext/pylons.html

* bug fixes


1.0.1
-----

* Bug fixes


1.0
---

* i18n support (gael.pasgrimaud)

* file upload support (gael.pasgrimaud)

* mapper property alias support (gael.pasgrimaud)

* add `kwargs` to FieldSet and Grid render methods, which are passed
  on to the template.  this allows easy custom template use w/o having
  to subclass.  (lbruno)

* removed query_options.  Just pass the query as the argument to the
  options parameter, and FA will turn it into (description, value)
  pairs.  FA will also accept an iterable of objects as a value to the
  options parameter.

* unicode(object) is used as the default option description, not
  str(object).  (Before, unicode was only used if the engine had
  convert_unicode turned on.)  This is more consistent with normal SA
  behavior.

* added sanity checks to disallow getting into an inconsistent state.
  notably, binding to an object that belongs to a session but does NOT
  have a primary key set is not allowed.  workaround: bind to the
  class, and FA will instantiate it and take it out of the session
  [until sync()].  Then you can pull that instance out as the .model
  attribute.

* sync() will save model to session, if necessary

* add Field.with_renderer

* allow manually-added fields to pull their value from the bound model

* fs.[field] returns the configured version of the field, not the
  unconfigured.  fs.fields renamed to fs._fields.  Added Field.reset()
  to deepcopy the unconfigured version.

* explicit renderers required for custom types (FieldRenderer.render removed)

* new documentation http://docs.formalchemy.org (gael.pasgrimaud)

* bug fixes


0.5.1
-----

* Synonym support

* Bug fixes


0.5
---

* Composite field and custom type support

* Joined table support

* Grid (companion to FieldSet) renders and edits multiple instances
  at once.

* readonly support for FieldSet (replacing undocumented Table), Grid
  (replacing TableCollection)

* FieldSet can render Fields from a non-mapped class (experimental)

* Saner (backwards-incompatible, but easy port) widget
  (FieldRenderer) API

* FieldSet.render_fields is now an OrderedDict like FieldSet.fields.
  Use render_fields.[iter]values() to get an iterable like the old
  render_fields.

* Bug fixes


0.3.1
-----

* Bug fixes

* Much better DateTime support

* Extensible widget API (want to use your favorite date picker instead?  No problem.)

* `FieldRenderer` is now part of `from formalchemy import *` for use here

* Minor changes to template API (details in documentation).  Does not affect
  you unless you already wrote a custom template

* order fields by declared order as much as possible, instead of alphabetical,
  when include= is absent

* Validator suite fleshed out (minlength, maxlength, regex, email, currency)

* Added doc sections on widget API and validation functions


0.3
---

* Completely new API, based on Fields instead of column names

* Support manually added Fields, not just attributes from the SA model

* Relations (a FK will be rendered with a dropdown of related objects)

* Validation + sync

* Template-based rendering for greater customizibility.  Tempita is included;
  Mako is detected and used if present

* WebHelpers is no longer a dependency; the small parts FA needs have been
  moved into helpers.py.  (This was prompted by WebHelpers 0.6 breaking
  backwards compatibility in nontrivial ways.)

* Pervasive docstrings

* Preliminary SA 0.5 support

* Regression test suite


0.2
---

* Added 'disable', 'disable_pk', 'disable_fk' options.

* Fixed a bug where 'readonly*' options only worked for 'password' fields.

* Added 'date', 'time' and 'datetime' options for date/time fields formatting.

* Added 'bool_as_radio' option.

* Added a hack to force browsers to POST unckecked checkboxes.

* Fixed a bug where 'opts' from the 'dropdown' option is no longer rendered as
  an attribute of the <select> tag.

* Fixed a compatibility issue with SQLAlchemy 0.4.1. The 'foreign_key' Column
  attribute is now 'foreign_keys'.

* Added 'fieldset' option.

* Added 'include' option. Patch from Adam Gomaa.

* Added 'textarea' option. Additionnal patch provided by Adam Gomaa for passing
  native tuple of intergers as `size` argument value.

* Added new experimental, little customizable, 'TableItem' and
  'TableCollection'. TableItem renders a table from a bound model.
  TableCollection renders a table from a collection of items that are of the
  same class than the bound model: TableCollection(bind=client,
  collection=client_list). The bound model can be a non-instantiated mapped
  class.

* Removed NullType type column detection for now, as it seems to be a SA 0.4
  only thing. What would a NullType HTML field represent anyway?

* FieldSet now returns fields embedded in <fieldset> HTML tags.

* Implemented the 'legend' option for FieldSet to provide an optional and
  customizable <legend> tag. FieldSet uses the bound model's class name as the
  legend by default. The legend can be customized by passing a string to the
  'legend' option: `legend='My legend'`. The fieldset can be legend-less by
  passing `legend=False`.

* Big core changes. Splitted the single formalchemy.py module into a
  formalchemy package. More classes, more flexibility. Plus, we're now using
  model-level and column-level rendering engines: 'ModelRenderer' and
  'FieldRenderer'.

* 'ModelRender' and 'FieldRender' allows you to render a whole model (like
  FieldSet, but without the fieldset/legend tags) or a single column.

* FieldSet now uses 'ModelRenderer'.

* Added new experimental, little customizable, non-form related, 'TableItem'
  and 'TableCollection'. TableItem renders a table from a bound model.
  TableCollection renders a table from a collection of items that are of the
  same class than the bound model: TableCollection(bind=client,
  collection=client_list). The bound model can be a non-instantiated mapped
  class.


0.1

* Initial release.
