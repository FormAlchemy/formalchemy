FormAlchemy 0.2:
  * Fixed a bug where 'opts' from the 'dropdown' option is no longer rendered as an attribute of the <select> tag.
  * Fixed a compatibility issue with SQLAlchemy 0.4.1. The 'foreign_key' Column attribute is now 'foreign_keys'.
  * Added 'fieldset' option.
  * Added 'include' option. Patch from Adam Gomaa.
  * Added 'textarea' option. Additionnal patch provided by Adam Gomaa for passing native tuple of intergers as `size` argument value.
  * Added new experimental, little customizable, 'TableItem' and 'TableCollection'. TableItem renders a table from a bound model. TableCollection renders a table from a collection of items that are of the same class than the bound model: TableCollection(bind=client, collection=client_list). The bound model can be a non-instantiated mapped class.
  * Removed NullType type column detection for now, as it seems to be a SA 0.4 only thing. What would a NullType HTML field represent anyway?
  * FieldSet now returns fields embedded in <fieldset> HTML tags.
  * Implemented the 'legend' option for FieldSet to provide an optional and customizable <legend> tag. FieldSet uses the bound model's class name as the legend by default. The legend can be customized by passing a string to the 'legend' option: `legend='My legend'`. The fieldset can be legend-less by passing `legend=False`.
  * Big core changes. Splitted the single formalchemy.py module into a formalchemy package. More classes, more flexibility. Plus, we're now using model-level and column-level rendering engines: 'ModelRenderer' and 'FieldRenderer'.
  * 'ModelRender' and 'FieldRender' allows you to render a whole model (like FieldSet, but without the fieldset/legend tags) or a single column.
  * FieldSet now uses 'ModelRenderer'.
  * Added new experimental, little customizable, non-form related, 'TableItem' and 'TableCollection'. TableItem renders a table from a bound model. TableCollection renders a table from a collection of items that are of the same class than the bound model: TableCollection(bind=client, collection=client_list). The bound model can be a non-instantiated mapped class.

FormAlchemy 0.1, r56:
  * Initial release.
