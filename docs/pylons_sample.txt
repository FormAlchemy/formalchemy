Pylons integration
==================

Imagine you have a `Foo` model in your `model/__init__.py` then your controller
can look like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../adminapp/adminapp/controllers/basic.py

If you have a lot of fieldset and configuration stuff and want to use them in
different controller, then you can create a `forms/` module to put your
fieldsets. This is a standard and allow you to use the
:mod:`formalchemy.ext.pylons` extension
