:mod:`formalchemy.ext.pylons` -- Pylons extensions
==================================================

.. automodule:: formalchemy.ext.pylons.controller

Administration interface
************************

Purpose
-------

The Pylons administration interface provides a simple way to enable
CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations on your SQLAlchemy
models, with a high degree of customizability.

Sample model listing:

.. image:: admin-models.png

Sample model overview page:

.. image:: admin-listing.png

Sample model creation page:

.. image:: admin-new.png


Setup
-----

First, generate a controller in your application::

  $ paster controller admin

Next, edit your ``controllers/admin.py``, replacing ``pylonsapp`` with your application name:

.. literalinclude:: ../../pylonsapp/pylonsapp/controllers/admin.py

Add these lines in ``config/routing.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../pylonsapp/pylonsapp/config/routing.py

All done!  Now you can go to the ``/admin/`` url.


Customization
-------------

:class:`~formalchemy.ext.pylons.controller.ModelsController` creates a new
class having `AdminControllerBase` and the internal FA models controller
(:class:`~formalchemy.ext.pylons.controller._ModelsController`) as its parent
classes, in that order.  

So, you can do simple customization just by overriding the
:class:`~formalchemy.ext.pylons.controller._ModelsController` methods  in
`AdminControllerBase`, e.g.,::

  class AdminControllerBase(BaseController):
      ...

      @auth_required
      def edit(self, *args, **kwargs):
          return super(AdminControllerBase, self).edit(*args, **kwargs)

To customize the forms used to list and edit your objects, 
create a module `yourapp.forms` and specify that
as the forms module in AdminController.  In this module, create 
:class:`~formalchemy.forms.FieldSet` (for create and edit forms)
and :class:`~formalchemy.tables.Grid` (for object lists) 
instances for the models you wish to customize.  (The `Grids` will
automatically get edit and delete links added, and be made readonly.)

See :mod:`~formalchemy.forms` for details on form configuration.

API
---

.. autofunction:: ModelsController

.. autoclass:: _ModelsController
   :members:

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you don't see all your models on the top-level admin page, you'll
need to import them into your model module, or tell `FormAlchemy` the
correct module to look in (the "model = " line in the controller class
you created).  In particular, `FormAlchemy` does not recursively scan
for models, so if you have models in e.g., `model/foo.py`, you will want
to add `from foo import *` in `model/__init__.py`.

Sample app 
----------

You can have a look at the complete `source
<http://code.google.com/p/formalchemy/source/browse/#hg/trunk/pylonsapp>`_ of
the application used for FA's testing.

.. _restfulcontroller:

RESTful controller
******************

This module provide a RESTful controller for formalchemy's FieldSets.

You can use your fieldset as a REST resource.

Listing::

    GET /owners

Get objects url via json::

    GET /owners.json

    GET /owners.json?page=2

    GET /owners
    Accept: application/json

New object with form::

    GET /owners/new

New object with json POST::

    POST /owners.json
    name:name
    animals: 1

View object with form::

    GET /owners/1

Get jsonify fieldset::

    GET /owners/1.json

Edit object with form::

    GET /owners/1/edit

Edit object with json PUT::

    PUT /owners/1.json

    {"name": "name", "animals": []}


Usage
------

Use the FieldSetController to wrap your Pylons controller:

.. autofunction:: formalchemy.ext.pylons.controller.RESTController

.. literalinclude:: ../../pylonsapp/pylonsapp/controllers/owners.py

Add this to your ``config/routing.py``:

.. sourcecode:: py

  map.resource('owner', 'owners')

Customisation
--------------

You can override the following methods:

.. autoclass:: formalchemy.ext.pylons.controller._RESTController
   :members:
