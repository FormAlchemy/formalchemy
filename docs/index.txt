Welcome to FormAlchemy's documentation!
=======================================

Introduction
------------

FormAlchemy greatly speeds development with SQLAlchemy mapped classes (models) in a HTML forms environment.

FormAlchemy eliminates boilerplate by autogenerating HTML input fields from a given model. FormAlchemy will try to figure out what kind of HTML code should be returned by introspecting the model's properties and generate ready-to-use HTML code that will fit the developer's application.

Of course, FormAlchemy can't figure out everything, i.e, the developer might want to display only a few columns from the given model. Thus, FormAlchemy is also highly customizable.

Features
--------

  * Generates HTML form fields from `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_
    mapped classes or manually added Fields

  * Works with declarative or classic mapper definitions

  * Render and edits single objects or collections (grids)

  * Handles `object relationships
    <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/05/ormtutorial.html#datamapping_relation>`_ 
    (including many-to-many), not just simple data types

  * `Synonym <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/05/mappers.html#advdatamapping_mapper_overriding>`_
    support

  * `Composite and custom type
    <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/05/mappers.html#advdatamapping_mapper_composite>`_
    support

  * Pre-fills input fields with current or default value

  * Highly customizable HTML output

  * Validates input and displays errors in-line

  * Syncs model instances with input data

  * Easy-to-use, extensible API

  * SQLAlchemy 0.4 (0.4.5 or later) and 0.5 compatible 

Limitations
-----------

  * Currently, `FormAlchemy` only handles single-valued (not composite)
    primary and foreign keys

FormAlchemy's current state
===========================

FormAlchemy is in alpha stage and the API is in constant
evolution. We think it's useful enough to release, but your code may
break from one version to another until FormAlchemy 1.0 is released.
